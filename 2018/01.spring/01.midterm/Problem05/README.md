Assume that you have a broken typewriter which cannot express vowels. For example, when a user types "abcde," the broken typewriter will give you "bcd."
Your program should satisfy the following requirements.
+ The length of the string cannot exceed 100 letters.

Refer the following code skeleton
```
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{ 
    char buff[1000];
    std::cout << "Enter a string " << std::endl;
    std::cout << ">>";










    return 0;
}
```
If you don't use "if statements", you get double points.
Also, you may check the result by entering the following command.
```
~/workspace/midterm/Problem05 (master) $./output
```
